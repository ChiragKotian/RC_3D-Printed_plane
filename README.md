# 3D-Printed RC plane

In this project, we tried to make the entire body of an RC plane using 3D printed parts which will be completely designed by us.

## Engineering Description:

The parts are printed using ABS material.

The wing was printed in three parts, joined together by resin-based glue, and supported by bicycle spokes and plastic rods running through it. Later the joints were covered with packing tape for a smoother surface so as to get a terbulence free flow of air.

Similarly, fuselage too was multi-part and was joined using a similar process.

In design, it was made sure to give ample access points to reach the electronics inside of the plane.

The landing gear structure is made from Aluminium and the wheels are of plastic. The design is such that the maximum of weight is distributed on a large area.

The motor used is a normal drone 1000kV brushless motor powered by a 30A ESC which is attached to 10 inch drone propeller.

The control surfaces like ailerons, horizontal stabilizers and rudders are actuated by 9g Servos.

Everything is controlled via a 6-channel Fly-sky transmitter.

Tail and Horizontal stabilizers are made out of MDF board due to their thin nature.
